CircuitVision by Sean Fottrell
based on program by Benjamin Lai

CircuitVision is designed to help teach fundamental concepts of electricity.
It uses a GUI to help the user lay out a simple circuit with resistors,
batteries, and wire. It then can create an animated 3-D model of the 
circuit to show show voltage gains and drops and show the current flow
through the circuit's branches.
